# Sensitivity-Towards-Physical-Transactions-V-s.-Digital-Transactions
This TYBAF Blackbook Project Report, titled “Consumer Behaviour Showcasing the Sensitivity towards Physical Transactions vs. Digitalised Transactions,” is a comprehensive study undertaken as part of my academic research and publication. The project aims to analyze consumer behaviour and their level of sensitivity when choosing between traditional physical transactions and modern digitalised payment methods.

In an era of rapid technological advancement, digital transactions have transformed the financial landscape, yet many consumers continue to rely on conventional methods due to factors such as trust, security concerns, and familiarity. This report examines these behavioural patterns by exploring the psychological, demographic, and socio-economic factors influencing consumer preferences.

Through surveys, data interpretation, and comparative analysis, the study provides valuable insights into the evolving payment ecosystem. The findings aim to help businesses, financial institutions, and policymakers better understand consumer expectations and strike a balance between physical and digital transaction systems.
